#**Overview of repository**

This repository contains information on my proposed project for the linear regression class. It contains files and folders on literature used, data package to be used, codes used and a transparency plan.


#**Project description:**
The project seeks to explore whether people's perception of climate change as a serious global problem influences their lifestyle and support for the fight against climate change.

# **Proposed Dataset to be used:**

The dataset from this project will be sourced from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), specifically Eurobarometer 83.4: Climate Change, Biodiversity, and ICPSR 36403 Discrimination of Minority Groups, May-June 2015

#**Variables to be included for this project:**

These will be developed after discussing the tentative project topic with the professor.
